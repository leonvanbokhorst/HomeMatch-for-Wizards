    "### 1.2 Synthetic Listing Generation\n",
    "\n",
    "After generating city contexts, we create detailed magical real estate listings for each city. This process involves using our LLM to generate rich, fantastical property descriptions that align with the unique characteristics of each magical location.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Listing Generation Process\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Single Listing Generation**: We use a carefully crafted prompt to generate individual listings, ensuring each property has unique features that fit the magical world.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Multiple Listings**: We generate multiple listings for each city context, creating a diverse range of properties within each magical location.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Error Handling and Retries**: To ensure robustness, we implement retry logic for listing generation, handling potential API errors or rate limiting issues.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Persistence**: Generated listings are saved to a JSON file, allowing for easy storage and retrieval of our magical property database.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Key Functions\n",
    "\n",
    "- `generate_single_listing`: Creates a single property listing using the LLM.\n",
    "- `generate_multiple_listings`: Generates multiple listings across different city contexts.\n",
    "- `save_listings_to_file`: Persists the generated listings to a JSON file.\n",
    "\n",
    "This approach allows us to create a rich, diverse database of magical properties that forms the foundation of our HomeMatch application."
